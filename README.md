# ETFCalc

## Objective
An [exchange traded fund (etf)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund) holds a number of underlying stocks. This tool attempts to simplify viewing the portion of a portfolio that is made up by the underlying stocks of ETFs. The tool allows a user to enter the list of stocks and ETFs held in their portfolio and will then calculate and output the percentage of the portfolio that each underlying stock makes up.

##  Steps Taken
I used this project to familiarize myself with web development and the flask framework. ETF holdings are scraped from either [etfdailynews](https://etfdailynews.com/) or [etfdb](https://etfdb.com/) depending on which is available. Stock price history and statistics are retrieved from [iextrading](https://iextrading.com/).
